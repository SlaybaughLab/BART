  deal.II defines a global Assert() macro that clashes with a
  gmock_internal_utils function.
  We want to keep the Assert macro out of
  gmock/internal/gmock-internal-utils.h, but still have it
  available for internal use by any deal.II file that may be
  included after this file.
  
  If Assert is defined, save its value, undefine it, include gmock, and
  redefine it; Else, simply include gmock.
